Purpose of this project is to implement evolution strategies for different problems. Simple Evolution, Simple Genetic, OpenAI's Evolution Strategy and a different Evolution Strategy model that is created for this project that uses dynamic standart deviation are implemented to be used for the problems. Models for different cases can be found in the relative folder. snakeGame folder includes the code for original playable version of snake game written with kivy and pygame.
